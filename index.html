        <h2>HOUR OF CODE DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>Hour of Code is a global event about coding.
            The Hour of Code is a global initiative occurring annually during Computer Science Education Week, usually in early December. <br>
            It is designed to introduce individuals, especially students, to the fundamentals of coding and computer science.
            The main objective is to debunk the complexities of coding, highlighting that anyone, regardless of their background or age,
            can grasp the basics of programming.<br>
            Participants in the Hour of Code are encouraged to dedicate at least one hour to coding activities, which can include guided tutorials and hands-on projects.
            The focus is on creating an accessible and enjoyable coding experience, emphasizing creativity and problem-solving skills.
            This initiative, organized by Code.org, seeks to inspire interest in computer science and foster a sense of inclusivity in the world of programming.

        <h2>Main Event</h2>
        <p>
            Team Star conducted Hour of Code in Baku Secondary School No. 44. 23 sixth-grade students were present in class.<br>
            With 6 computer-based and paper-based activities, pupils participated in both individual and teamwork.<br>
            Students patiently solved given problems and learned unfamiliar terms. We tried to explain this information through slides and games to make it more interesting for children.<br>
            The students' appreciation of this knowledge and respect for us caused them to say heartwarming thoughts about the students of school No. 44. In addition, on Code.org, children have shown how they are actively absorbing our knowledge.<br>

                    As we mentioned above, we conducted this event at School #44. Although it is located quite far from the capital and the weather was poor, we did not hesitate to execute our mission. In addition, students' enthusiasm encouraged us to do even better than what we had planned. We would like to convey our gratitude to teacher Aziza Aliyeva and principal Vusal Mursaliyev for letting us carry out this event.
